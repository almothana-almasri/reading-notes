# Engineering Readings

1. **Unique quality I bring to a career and potential employer:**

My unique combination of honesty, problem-solving skills, ability to approach problems from different angles, and loyalty sets me apart from others in the field. These qualities enable me to build trust with colleagues and clients, develop innovative solutions to challenges, and demonstrate a strong commitment to the success of the team and organization.

2. **Three strategies to "un-stick" myself when encountering a challenging piece of code, logic, or feature:**

  a) *Break down the problem:* Following the principles of "How to think like a programmer" and "Solving Problems," I will break down the complex problem into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach simplifies the issue and makes it easier to understand and tackle.

  b) *Employ the 5 Whys:* By asking "why" five times, I can identify the root cause of the problem and better understand the underlying issues. This technique helps me to think critically and identify any knowledge gaps or misunderstandings that may be causing the problem.

  c) *Embrace the Super Mario Effect:* The Super Mario Effect teaches us to focus on the process and learning experience rather than the fear of failure. I will approach challenges with a growth mindset, treating setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. By concentrating on my progress and learning, I can stay motivated and persistent even when faced with tough obstacles.
