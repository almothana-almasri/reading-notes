## Reading Class-30: Hash Tables

Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are efficient data structures for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. They use a hash function to compute a hash value, which is used as an index to store or retrieve data in an array-like structure called a hash table. Collisions, when two different inputs produce the same hash value, are handled using techniques like separate chaining or open addressing. Hash tables offer constant-time average-case complexity for these operations, making them widely used in programming for various applications.

- **Hash Function**: Computes a hash value based on an input (key).
- **Index Calculation**: Hash value is used to determine the index in the hash table.
- **Collision Handling**: Techniques like separate chaining or open addressing deal with collisions.
- **Operations**: Insertion, retrieval, and deletion are the main operations supported by hash tables.

Hash tables are commonly used to implement associative arrays, databases, caches, and symbol tables due to their efficient performance.
