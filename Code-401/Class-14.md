## key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries

- Matplotlib: It is suitable for creating basic as well as complex visualizations. However, it can sometimes require more code to produce visually appealing plots compared to other libraries.

Example: if you need to create a highly customized line plot with specific colors, markers, and annotations.

- Seaborn: can generate aesthetically pleasing plots with fewer lines of code compared to Matplotlib. It offers a variety of built-in plot types and themes.

Example: Seaborn is particularly useful when you want to quickly explore and visualize relationships in your data. For instance.

- Bokeh: It allows you to create interactive and dynamic plots, charts, and dashboards.

Example: Bokeh is a great choice when you need to create interactive visualizations for web applications.

## In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots?

- Relational plots: The main function for creating relational plots in Seaborn is `scatterplot()`. It is used to show the relationship between two numerical variables. The purpose of a relational plot is to visualize the correlation or distribution of data points.

Example: If you have a dataset containing information about students' test scores and their study time, you can use `scatterplot()` to create a scatter plot to examine the relationship between study time and test scores.

- Categorical plots: Seaborn provides various functions for creating categorical plots, including `boxplot()`, `barplot()`, `countplot()`, `violinplot()`, and more. These plots are used to visualize the distribution of data within categories or to compare different categories.

Example: Suppose you have a dataset with information about sales performance of different products in different regions. You can use `barplot()` to create a bar plot that shows the average sales for each product category in different regions.

- Distribution plots: Seaborn offers functions such as `histplot()`, `kdeplot()`, and `rugplot()` for visualizing distributions of variables. These plots help you understand the underlying distribution of data points and can be useful for exploring data or identifying patterns.

Example: If you have a dataset containing the ages of a group of individuals, you can use `histplot()`

## Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet is a quick reference guide that provides an overview of the key functionalities and syntax of Seaborn.

- Plot types: The cheat sheet provides examples and brief explanations of various plot types available in Seaborn, such as scatter plots, bar plots, box plots, violin plots, etc.

- Functions: It lists the main functions for each plot type, making it easy to find the appropriate function for a specific visualization task.

- Customization options: The cheat sheet showcases different customization options available in Seaborn, such as changing colors, adjusting plot aesthetics, adding titles and labels, modifying legends, etc.
