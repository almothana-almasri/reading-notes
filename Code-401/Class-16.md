# Serverless Functions

## What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically provisions and scales resources as needed.

1. No server management: With serverless, developers don't have to worry about provisioning, scaling, or maintaining servers. The cloud provider handles the underlying infrastructure.

2. Pay-per-use pricing: Serverless platforms charge based on the actual usage of resources rather than a fixed price. You pay only for the time your function is running and the resources it consumes.

3. Automatic scaling: Serverless platforms automatically scale the resources allocated to your functions based on demand. They can handle sudden spikes in traffic without manual intervention.

4. Stateless functions: Serverless functions are stateless, meaning they don't retain any memory of previous invocations. This allows for easier scaling and fault tolerance.

Traditional server-based architectures involve managing and maintaining servers or virtual machines. Resources need to be provisioned in advance, and scaling requires manual intervention. The cost is typically fixed, regardless of usage. Serverless computing abstracts away these infrastructure concerns, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing servers.

## How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

Install Vercel:
```bash
npm install vercel
```

Initialize a new Vercel project:
```bash
vercel init
```
This command will guide you through the project initialization process and create a `vercel.json` file in your project directory.

Write your serverless function code in a file, e.g., `api/my-function.py`. The file should export a function that handles the incoming request.

Deploy the serverless function:
```bash
vercel
```

## What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They enable developers to access and manipulate data from external sources, such as web services, databases, or other online platforms. APIs define the available endpoints, data formats, authentication methods, and actions that can be performed.

In Python applications, APIs can be utilized to interact with external sources by making HTTP requests to API endpoints. Python provides various libraries to simplify working with APIs, such as the Requests library.

## What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

The Requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests.

It provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with web services and APIs. Here's an example of making a basic GET request using the Requests library:

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request to an API endpoint
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Access the response content
    data = response.json()
    # Process the data or perform desired actions

    # Example: Print the response content
    print(data)
else:
    # Request was not successful, handle the error
    print('Request failed with status code:', response.status_code)
```
