# Linked Lists and Big(O) Anylsis

In this lesson, we'll explore the concept of linked lists, a data structure that can be used to store a collection of elements. And the Big(O) Anylsis of linked lists.

## **Linked Lists:**

A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements, called nodes. Each node contains two parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are different from arrays, as they don't require a continuous block of memory and can easily grow or shrink in size.

There are several types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Singly linked lists have a reference only to the next node, while doubly linked lists have references to both the next and previous nodes. In circular linked lists, the last node points back to the first node, creating a loop.

## **Big O Analysis:**

Big O notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm or data structure, providing an estimation of the time complexity (how long it takes to run) or space complexity (how much memory is required). It helps to compare different algorithms and understand their efficiency in terms of growth rate as the input size increases.

For linked lists, the Big O analysis for common operations are as follows:

1. Accessing an element by index:
   - Worst case: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the linked list. In the worst case, we need to traverse the entire list to find the desired element.

2. Searching for an element:
   - Worst case: O(n), as it may require traversing the entire list to find the element.

3. Insertion:
   - At the beginning: O(1), since we only need to update the head pointer and the next pointer of the new node.
   - At the end: O(n) for a singly linked list, because we need to traverse the list to reach the last node. O(1) for a doubly linked list, as we can directly access the last node through the previous pointer of the head node.
   - In the middle: O(n), since, in the worst case, we might have to traverse half of the list to reach the insertion point.

4. Deletion:
   - At the beginning: O(1), as we only need to update the head pointer.
   - At the end: O(n) for a singly linked list, because we need to traverse the list to reach the last node. O(1) for a doubly linked list, as we can directly access the last node and its previous node.
   - In the middle: O(n), since, in the worst case, we might have to traverse half of the list to reach the deletion point.

In conclusion, linked lists offer efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays, but accessing and searching elements can take longer, as we need to traverse the list. The Big O analysis helps to understand the performance characteristics of linked lists and compare them with other data structures.
