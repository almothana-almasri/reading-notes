## **Beginners Guide to Big O**

Time complexity and space complexity describe an algorithm's performance. Time complexity refers to the execution time, while space complexity refers to the memory usage. Both are represented using Big O notation, which describes the worst-case scenario. Understanding these complexities helps us choose efficient algorithms for specific tasks and data sets.

## **Names and Values in Python**

In Python, data types are classified as mutable or immutable based on whether their values can be altered after creation.

**Immutable data types** have a fixed value once they are created. Any operation that seems to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the modified value. Examples of immutable data types in Python include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

**Mutable data types** can have their values changed after creation. Operations on mutable data types can modify the original object without creating a new one. Examples of mutable data types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
