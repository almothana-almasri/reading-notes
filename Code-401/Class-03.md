# FileIO & Exceptions

## Why This Topic Matters

FileIO and Exceptions are essential for Python developers. FileIO enables data storage, analysis, and manipulation, while exception handling allows creating robust, error-resistant programs.

## Reading Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of the `with` statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?**

The purpose of the `with` statement when opening a file in Python is to simplify resource management. The `with` statement is used in conjunction with a context manager, which automatically handles the opening and closing of the file. This ensures that the file is properly closed even if an exception occurs within the block. It helps manage resources by preventing potential leaks and ensuring that the file is closed when it is no longer needed.

2. **Explain the difference between the `read()` and `readline()` methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.**

    - `read()`: This method reads the entire content of the file into a single string. It is useful when you want to process the whole content at once or when the file is small enough to fit in memory.

    ```python
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    ```
    - `readline()`: This method reads a single line from the file, including the newline character at the end of the line. It is useful when you want to process the file line by line, especially for large files where reading the entire content into memory is not possible.

    ```python
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    line = file.readline()
    while line:
        print(line.strip())
        line = file.readline()
    ```

3. **Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.**

    Exception handling in Python is a way to manage runtime errors that may occur during the execution of a program. It allows the program to continue running even if an error occurs, and provides a mechanism to handle the error gracefully.

The `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks are used to handle exceptions as follows:

- `try`: This block contains the code that may potentially raise an exception. If an exception is raised, the program jumps to the corresponding `except` block.
- `except`: This block contains the code to handle the exception. It is executed when an exception is raised in the `try` block. You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
- `finally`: This block contains the code that should always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is useful for cleaning up resources or ensuring that certain actions are performed even in the presence of an error.


    ```python
    try:
        result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    finally:
        print("This will always be printed.")
    ```
