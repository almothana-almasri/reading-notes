## Dunder methods

Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are special functions in Python that provide a way to define the behavior of classes and objects in specific situations. They are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., dunder) at the beginning and end of their names.

The purpose of dunder methods is to enable developers to customize the default behavior of Python objects and classes. By implementing dunder methods, you can define how instances of your custom classes behave in different contexts, such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, string representations, and more.

Here's an example of a commonly used dunder method, `__str__`, which is used to provide a string representation of an object:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person(name={self.name}, age={self.age})"

person = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person)  # Output: Person(name=Alice, age=30)
```

In this example, the `__str__` method is defined within the `Person` class to customize the string representation of `Person` objects. When `print(person)` is called, it invokes the `__str__` method, which returns a formatted string representation of the object.

##  the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,”

The main ethical issue raised in the video is the lack of proper attribution and misrepresentation of the authorship of code used by Suraj Raval in his educational materials. Suraj was accused of taking code from other developers without giving them proper credit or acknowledgment. This behavior was considered unethical because it violated the principles of intellectual property and academic integrity.

To avoid this ethical issue, Suraj Raval could have implemented the following practices:

1. Properly attribute the code

2. Seek permission: If Suraj intended to use someone else's code extensively or as a core component of his educational materials

3. Create original content: Instead of relying heavily on code from others

By following these practices, Suraj Raval could have avoided the ethical concerns raised in the video and maintained a more transparent and ethical approach to his educational materials.

## Python statistics module

Python `statistics` module, it is a built-in module that provides a set of functions for mathematical statistics operations. This module offers various statistical functions to analyze data, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, correlation, and more.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of the `mean` function from the `statistics` module to calculate the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers:

```python
import statistics

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
mean_value = statistics.mean(data)

print(mean_value)  # Output: 6
```

In this example, the `mean` function is used to calculate the mean value of the `data` list, which contains the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The result, 6, is printed to the console. The `statistics` module provides various other functions such as `median`, `mode`, `stdev`, and more, allowing you to perform different statistical operations on your data.
