## Reading Class-36: Graphs

A **graph** is a data structure used to represent relationships between entities. It consists of **nodes** (vertices) and **edges** connecting these nodes. Graphs can be categorized into:

- **Undirected Graphs:** Edges have no direction. Used for symmetric relationships like friendships.

- **Directed Graphs (Digraphs):** Edges have direction. Represent asymmetric relationships like followers on social media.

Graphs can also have **weighted edges** representing values like distances or costs. They can be acyclic (no cycles) or cyclic (contain cycles).

Common graph algorithms include:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores graph level by level, useful for shortest paths.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores deeply before backtracking, used for cycle detection and traversal.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths in weighted graphs.

- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths with negative edge weights.

- **Topological Sorting:** Orders nodes in a directed acyclic graph.
