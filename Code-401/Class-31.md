## Reading Class-31: Django REST Framework & Docker

1. **Docker: Key components and benefits**
   - **Docker Image:** A lightweight, executable package with everything needed to run an app. Ensures consistent environments and easy sharing.
   - **Container:** An instance of a Docker image running as an isolated process. Offers portability and scalability.
   - **Dockerfile:** Instructions to build a Docker image, enabling automated and reproducible builds.
   - **Docker Registry:** Stores and distributes Docker images, promoting collaboration and reusability.
   - **Docker Compose (optional):** Defines multi-container applications, simplifying management.

2. **Building a Django Library Website**
   - **Models:** Define data structure (books, authors, etc.).
   - **Views:** Handle HTTP requests and generate responses.
   - **Templates:** Present data using HTML templates.
   - **URL Configuration:** Map URLs to views.
   - **Static/Media Files:** Serve CSS, images, and handle media uploads.
   - **Authentication:** Implement user account management.
   - **Admin Interface:** Customize the admin interface for easy data management.
   - **Testing:** Write test cases to ensure functionality.
   - **Deployment:** Prepare for production deployment.

3. **Django vs. Django REST framework**
   - **Django:** General-purpose web framework for web applications with MVC pattern. Includes a template engine and supports web page views and form submissions.
   - **Django REST framework:** Specialized extension for building Web APIs with REST architecture, serialization, authentication, and other API-specific tools. Ideal for serving JSON/XML data to client-side applications.
