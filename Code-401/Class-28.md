# Reading Class-27: Django CRUD and Forms

1. Django Forms facilitate user input handling by providing an easy way to define and process HTML forms. 
Key components include:
    - defining a form class,
    - rendering the form in templates,
    - handling form submission,
    - and displaying form errors.

2. Django Templates separate presentation logic from business logic in web development. Template inheritance improves code reusability and maintainability by allowing the creation of a base template that can be extended by other templates, avoiding code duplication and enabling consistent updates.

3. Django Views handle HTTP requests, containing the application's business logic. Function-based views (FBVs) are simpler and suitable for smaller views, while class-based views (CBVs) provide more structure, support for different HTTP methods, and code organization, making them suitable for larger, complex views. CBVs promote code reuse and maintainability.
