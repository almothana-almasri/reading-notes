## Reading Class-41: React 4

**1. Dynamic Routes vs. Static Routes in Next.js**

Dynamic routes generate pages based on URL parameters for dynamic content. Static routes pre-render pages at build time for faster performance and SEO benefits.

**2. Deploying a Next.js Application**

Deploying a Next.js app involves: building the app (`npm run build`), selecting a platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), configuring settings, and deploying. The platform provides a URL for your app.

**3. Handling Static File Serving in Next.js**

Store static files in `/public`. Images go in `/public/images` and are referenced as `/images/my-image.jpg`. Stylesheets go in `/public/styles` and can be linked with `<link href="/styles/main.css" />`.
