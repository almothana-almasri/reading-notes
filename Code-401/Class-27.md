# Reading Class-27: Django Models

1. Django models define the structure and behavior of data stored in a database. They simplify database management by providing an abstraction layer and handling SQL queries automatically.

2. The Django Admin interface is a pre-built administrative interface for managing database records. It offers features like CRUD operations, list and detail views, filtering, searching, and sorting. It can be customized by overriding default classes, creating custom views, and modifying templates.

3. Django applications consist of models (defining data structure), views (handling HTTP requests), templates (generating HTML responses), and URLs (mapping requests to views). These components work together: views interact with models, templates render data, and URLs route requests to the appropriate views. Forms handle user input and validation.
