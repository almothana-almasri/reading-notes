# Engineering Readings

1. **Unique quality I bring to a career and potential employer:**

My unique combination of honesty, problem-solving skills, ability to approach problems from different angles, and loyalty sets me apart from others in the field. These qualities enable me to build trust with colleagues and clients, develop innovative solutions to challenges, and demonstrate a strong commitment to the success of the team and organization.

2. **Three strategies to "un-stick" myself when encountering a challenging piece of code, logic, or feature:**

  a) *Break down the problem:* Following the principles of "How to think like a programmer" and "Solving Problems," I will break down the complex problem into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach simplifies the issue and makes it easier to understand and tackle.

  b) *Employ the 5 Whys:* By asking "why" five times, I can identify the root cause of the problem and better understand the underlying issues. This technique helps me to think critically and identify any knowledge gaps or misunderstandings that may be causing the problem.

  c) *Embrace the Super Mario Effect:* The Super Mario Effect teaches us to focus on the process and learning experience rather than the fear of failure. I will approach challenges with a growth mindset, treating setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. By concentrating on my progress and learning, I can stay motivated and persistent even when faced with tough obstacles.

# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. One of the more important things to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the time complexity and efficiency of operations that will be performed frequently on the data structure. Choosing the appropriate data structure can greatly impact the overall performance and speed of the algorithm.

2. To ensure that we'll avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we should implement a base case or a stopping condition in our recursive function. A base case is a simple problem that can be solved without further recursion. By providing a base case, the function will eventually stop calling itself, thus preventing an infinite loop and potential stack overflow errors. Additionally, it is essential to make progress towards the base case with each recursive call, ensuring that the function converges to a solution.

# The Command Line

The command line is a text-based interface for interacting with the computer. It allows us to execute commands and perform various tasks, like navigating directories and manipulating files.

## Basic Navigation

    cd: Change the current directory
    ls: List the contents of a directory
    pwd: Print the current working directory

## More About Files

    Files and directories can have hidden attributes, like read, write, and execute permissions.
    file: Determine the type of a file
    ls -l: Show detailed information about files and directories, including permissions

## Manual Pages

    man: Access the manual page for a specific command, providing detailed information about its usage and options

## File Manipulation

    mkdir: Create a new directory
    rmdir: Remove an empty directory
    rm: Remove a file or directory (with the -r option)
    cp: Copy a file or directory
    mv: Move or rename a file or directory
