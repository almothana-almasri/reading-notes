# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. One of the more important things to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the time complexity and efficiency of operations that will be performed frequently on the data structure. Choosing the appropriate data structure can greatly impact the overall performance and speed of the algorithm.

2. To ensure that we'll avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we should implement a base case or a stopping condition in our recursive function. A base case is a simple problem that can be solved without further recursion. By providing a base case, the function will eventually stop calling itself, thus preventing an infinite loop and potential stack overflow errors. Additionally, it is essential to make progress towards the base case with each recursive call, ensuring that the function converges to a solution.
